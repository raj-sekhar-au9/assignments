# Question 1: Play with repl while running commands and operators.

a = 5
b = 4

c = a + b 

c = a * b 
c = a - b
c = a / b


# Question 2: Given a no print its remainder. Which command will you use ?

number = 10,  
remainder_of_number = 10%2

# Question 3: Experiment with str concatenation.

first_name = "raj"
last_name = "selkhar"

print(first_name + last_name)

# or 

print("raj" + "sekhar")

# Question 4: try naming some variables and see what all variables names throws error .

a = 10 
# no error
_12345 = "raj"
# no error 
Base = 200
# no error 
123_number = "assignment 1"
# error 
%python = "language"
# error 

# from the following result, its concluded that any variable starting with  a-z,A-Z or _ is considered as a variable and otherwise will give an error 

# Question 5: Explore more on the things we learned in the class.
# answer -  I learnt about if, elif and else statements
